Inside the prefabs folder are 2 prefabs related to items. The SSI2_Inventory Object prefab (The block that appears in the UI) and SSI2 Sample Item (The physical object that you pick up)
This section will look at the former, as it contains a few things you may wish to edit, there isn't too much you have to edit.

The object itself has an Image component in it with a transparent white colour, to act as the border/bounds of the item itself and to show how much space it occupies, you can change this or hide it.
The quantityText object is the text that shows how much of an item there are in a stack, you may wish to change the position of it.
