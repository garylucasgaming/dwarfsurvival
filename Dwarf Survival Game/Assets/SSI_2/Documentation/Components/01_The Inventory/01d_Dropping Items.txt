Dropping items has been split into 2 sections, Dropping Items (in general) and Dropping Quantities of Items (if you have a stack, a dialog box will appear asking how much you want to drop/split)

Unless you wish to redesign the dialog box from the ground up with new components, keep the values in the Dropping Quantities of Items section the same.

Dropping Destroys Items is fairly self explanatory, if it's True, an item will be destroyed rather than dropped to the ground
The Drop Point determines the object from which the dropped items will appear, in the Sample Scene it is set to the Main Camera
Drop Velocity Local and Variance dictates the speed at which the dropped objects move
Local - How much it moves relative to the direction the Drop Point is facing, this is fixed in runtime
Variance - How much the velocity may deviate (Example: A Local Velocity with x-value 1 and Variance with x-value 0.25 may have an x-velocity between 0.75 and 1.25)
