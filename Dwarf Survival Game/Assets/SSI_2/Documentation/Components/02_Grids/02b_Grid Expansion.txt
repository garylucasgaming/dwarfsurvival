This section of the SSI2_GridScript dictates auto-expansion of grids, when an object is picked up and placed in the grid, if it does not fit naturally, the grid will expand to suit it
if the grid is marked as Expanding

The target width to height ratio is the value at which the height will increase when the width is greater than or equal to X times the height, the expansions will prioritise width otherwise
