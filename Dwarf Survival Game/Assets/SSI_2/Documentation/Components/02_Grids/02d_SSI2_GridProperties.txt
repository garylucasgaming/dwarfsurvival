This script is used to create a new grid in run-time, say, you have a backpack which you can use, you'll need an SSI2_GridProperties script to refer to when you call the SSI2_InventoryScript's
CreateGrid function. If you wish to bind the backpack to the grid itself, you'll need to add the GridProperties script to an object with the SSI2_ItemScript component, and set the createdFromItem boolean
in the CreateGrid function parameters to True
