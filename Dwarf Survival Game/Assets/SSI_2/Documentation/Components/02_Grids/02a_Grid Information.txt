This section of the SSI2_GridScript dictates the name of the grid, the dimensions and if it can be removed from the main Inventory.
	- Grid Name: The name of the grid
	- Grid Removeable: Can we remove this grid from the system? 
	- Column & Row Count: Defines the dimensions of the grid
	- Accepted Items: The list of tags or item names that the grid can accept, leave empty to accept all items

The Name Text and Remove Button variables are just used to create the headers and adds a button to remove the grid should it be possible to remove it.
