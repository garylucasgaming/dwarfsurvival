Here are the key functions that you may wish to access in runtime for the SSI2_GridScript component:

SnatchItem(item : SSI2_ItemScript, out result : bool):
	Take an existing item in your inventory and move it to this grid, if it does not fit, return it to it's original position.

	When the transfer begins, it calls the SSI2_InventoryScript's Transferring Item events.
	When the transfer succeeds, it calls the SSI2_InventoryScript's Transferred Item events.
	When the transfer fails, it calls the SSI2_InventoryScript's Fail Transfer events.

SnatchFrom:
	Gives the first item in this grid's inventory back to the handler to place in the first available space.
